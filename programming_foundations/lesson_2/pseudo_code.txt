Pseudo code for a method that returns the sum of two integers:
START
SET variable for integer_1
SET variable for integer_2

integer_1 + integer_2

END



Pseudo code for a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together:
START
SET variable for array
SET iterator = 1
SET variable for new_string
WHILE iterator < index of array
  SET new_string << value at each index of the array
iterator += 1

END


Pseudo code for a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element:
START
SET variable for array
SET variable for new_array
iterator = 1
WHILE iterator < index of array
  SET new_array << value at even number indexes
END
